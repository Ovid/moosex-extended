          - Reorganize docs to provide links to a manual
          - Make cloning much more flexible (thanks to Leon Timmermans for
            pointing out that my previous approach wasn't enough).

            excluding it (in Moose, the class silently ignores the role method)

          - Role support added
          - make_immutable is now the default (thanks, haarg)
