          - "naked" fields (those no writer, default, or builder) that cannot
            have a value set will now issue a warning. (thanks, tobyink)
          - `is => 'rwp'` is now supported
          - Use new version of B::Hooks::AtRuntime. Classes now remain
            immutable under the debugger. Thanks to haarg and Ben Morrow for
            following up on that.
          - Move perl critic deps to test dependencies and update
            dist.ini in the process.

          - `builder` can now accept a coderef (stolen from Moo). (thanks,
            tobyink)
          - Disable true/make_immutable when loaded via stringy eval (thanks,
            tobyink)

          - Fixed bug where passing a reference to a constructor for a cloned
            attribute wouldn't be cloned at first.
          - B::Hooks::AtRuntime and true.pm are not loaded unless required
          - Add CONTRIBUTING.md
          - Test and document that postfix (package Foo {...}) syntax is not

0.04      2022-05-25 10:41:10 CEST
          - Moved critic and tidy tests to xt/author to prevent false
            negatives on CPAN testers

0.03      2022-05-24 18:28:10 CEST

          - Fix broken POD name, causing the overview to not be linked

0.01      2022-05-24 09:44:44 CEST

          - Reorganize docs to provide links to a manual
          - Make cloning much more flexible (thanks to Leon Timmermans for
            pointing out that my previous approach wasn't enough).
          - Start adding exceptions
          - Throw exceptions if attribute names or shortcut names are invalid

          - Role support added
          - make_immutable is now the default (thanks, haarg)
