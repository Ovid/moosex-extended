This is an attempt to exercise the bug described in
https://github.com/Ovid/moosex-extended/issues/41.

In short, with Test::Compile, we have intermittent segfault when using
'immutable'. However, that's a proprietary codebase that cannot be shared.
Thus, we're using this to try to shake out the bug, but so far, we can't.
